          <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="description">
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and
            development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment
            based on screen size, platform and orientation.
          </p>
          <p class="second-paragraph">
            The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images
            and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches
            from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch
            to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
            One may also have to consider the settings on their devices; if they
            have a VPN for iOS on their iPad, for example, the website should
            not block the user’s access to the page. In other words, the website
            should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s
            preferences. This would eliminate \ the need for a different design
            and development phase for each new gadget on the market.
          </p>
          <p class="third-paragraph">
            Responsive web design works through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
            using various settings to serve different style properties depending
            on the screen size, orientation, resolution, color capability, and
            other characteristics of the user’s device. A few examples of CSS
            properties related to responsive web design include the viewport and
            media queries.
